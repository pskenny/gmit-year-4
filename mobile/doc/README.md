## Game Mechanics

## Story

The player is the main character, a clam. The story is represents the internal dialogue of the character learning something new. 

Consisting of three acts taking from certain aspects of [The Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey):

The narrator descibes the negative side of the character; doubt, self-hatred, etc.

### Act 1: Introduction

You are new and don't know how to play. The narrator starts with the following dialogue:

Narrator: Hello. Welcome. This is an experiment. I hope you stay until the end. Nothing is new, only rehashed, stolen, plagarised, morphed from others constituent parts. Throwing noise into the void. Begin. Begin. Begin. Begin.

This descibes beginning something. You are not original when you begin to learn something, you are using what others who are already skilled/knowledable and creating something from these building blocks.

### Act 2: Death/Failure

### Act 3: Resurrection/Success
