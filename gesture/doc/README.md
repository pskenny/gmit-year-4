# Gesture Based User Interface Experience - Evolution and Challenges

[From project specification given by Damian Costello]

Write a research paper based on the title provided. The purpose of this exercise is to research the User Interface as it moves from purely physical (mouse, keyboard, touch screen) to include intuitive interaction through gestures. The paper should be 3 – 3500 words in length excluding references. Write up the project under the following headings including all references as evidence of your research.

User Experience Evolution – Originally with just a keyboard and screen, computers have evolved to include a mouse, touch screen, voice control, virtual & augmented spaces and gesture recognition. What is the User Experience and what are the drivers in the evolution process? Why are users never happy with the current iteration of interaction with computing systems? What are the challenges faced by each generation as new interactions are marketed to users from both acceptance and implementation perspectives?

Gestures as a communication tool – how are gestures used in everyday life for communication with others? They are a universal tool albeit without a unilateral meaning and interpretation. How a gesture is defined and how does it become accepted to represent various aspects of communication?

Challenges for design of applications – Incorporating gestures is an important part of the design phase. Using the wrong gestures will leave users confused and frustrated as they learn a new system. The functionality of the system has to be appropriately mapped to the gesture set available in such a way to reduce the learning curve and the resistance gradient of the user.

Challenges for implementation – deciding that a particular gesture should carry out a particular function is one thing, actually tracking that gesture and deciding when it has been made is a different challenge. Looking at some systems and the gestures they use, what are the challenges in implementation that had to be overcome for those systems? How were those challenges met (if they were met)?

Conclusions – Conclusions are what you have learned from your research. This is your reflection on the current state of the art and the possible future directions of gesture-based user interfaces.
