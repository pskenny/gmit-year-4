# Gesture Based UI Application

[From project specification given by Damian Costello]

Develop an application with a Voice Based interface. You will need to define the grammar set that can be used with your application and provide a table of commands with equivalent actions in your application. At the very least, this should be a static set of commands, but designed in a way that could easily be expanded when required.

You can reproduce a classic game or system using a gesture-based interface for your application. Creating a skill in Alexa for the sake of creating a skill is not enough. You need to take the application further than this. You could, for example, implement a simple learning mechanism that will build a conversational skill as time progresses and demonstrate this. You could use the voice control to progress through a game or achieve a task. If you are doing this, then you need to distinguish the code you write from the samples available.

The programming language is your choice.
